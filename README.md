# GMM
Implementing and applying EM algorithm with a Gaussian Mixture model from scratch.

Used Iris Dataset.
Plotted the Sepal data points with a color coding based on the obtained clusters.
Plotted the data points with color where the RGB colour values correspond to the probability estimates of a data point belonging to each class.
Calculated prediction accuracy with different numbers of assumed classes for k=2,3, and 4.
Used numpy.linalg.pinv to find the inverse of a matrix. Also, numpy.copy to temporary save a vector.
